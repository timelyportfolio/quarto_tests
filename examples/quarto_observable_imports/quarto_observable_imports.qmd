## Observable Power of Community

Quarto integrates Observable JavaScript cells which means we can leverage the amazing work of others contributed on Observable. I was surprised that none of the `ojs`examples I found show how to import from other notebooks to maximize the power of collective genius. See [observable imports](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/import) for more details on the deliberate efforts by Observable to allow easy integration of the work of others.

## License

I should note to please check license before importing a notebook.  Thanks Sean Lopp for the [tweet](https://twitter.com/lopp_sean/status/1556292338221080577?s=20&t=QRGZ1_nB-RmxUgSUkyADUg).  In the below example, we are safe with the `ISC` license.

### Example with [Summary Table](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/summary-table)

As an example, we can import the very promising work from [Mike Freeman](https://observablehq.com/@mkfreeman) on the Observable team summarizing the `penquins` data set, but if you want too bring your own data, then we can supply that feature as well. With four lines of `ojs` code, we get something pretty amazing.

```{ojs}
import {viewof data} from "@observablehq/summary-table"
viewof data
```

```{ojs}
import {viewof summary_data} from "@observablehq/summary-table"
viewof summary_data
```

### Helper For More Complicated Imports

In many cases observable cells have a clear name, but sometimes it is a little less straightforward. For instance, in the example above, instead of a simple one-word cell name, we use `viewof summary_data`. Fortunately, Observable now provides a helper to grab the name. Hovering over a cell reveals a three vertical dot button to the left. If we click on the three-dot button, then we get a `Copy Import`option.
